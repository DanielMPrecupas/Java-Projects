Play:
	Each player throws the dice to decide the order of the turns.
	Players start on Board[0], the following rounds reset the Board to 0.
	Players can buy properties; rent is charged when other players land on those properties.
	When a player owns every property of one color, they can place houses, which raises the rent for said property.
	When a player owns four houses, they can build a hotel on the lot, returning the houses to the bank.
	If a player is unable to pay off the rent to another player, they are given multiple options:
		- selling a house to the bank for half the price;
		- selling a house to another player for a specified price;
		- if said player does not own anything, they are declared bankrupt, and outed from the game.
	Everytime the player passes through the GO (Board[0]) square, they are given $200.
